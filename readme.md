## Process of Getting Data

1. At first user will enter his name, upload his pancard and allow us to take snapshots of his face.
2. Then we save it in a database and allot one unique id to each user which contains their name followed by random strings.
3. Then we extract name and pan id from the uploaded pan card.
4. Then we will train the facenet model with the given snapshots and save the trained modelwith same name.

## Process of Using Data

1. They will be asked to put their given id.
2. Then we will ask them to allow us to for taking their picture.
3. Then with facial recognition we will se whether the id of the recognised face is same or different.
4. If it same then continue otherwise dicontinue.
